Ox code for inference for jump-diffusions Manuscript: Exact Monte Carlo likelihood-based inference for jump-diffusion processes. Authors: Flávio Gonçalves, Krzysztof Latuszynski and Gareth Roberts.

The algorithms are coded in Ox

Please, download Ox Console (including OxEdit) from the link https://www.doornik.com/download.html. Ox is free for academic use.


For all the examples, there is a main file which is the one to be run and contains all the required specifications to be set.

The datasets used in the paper are saved under the file XX.mat inside the respective folders of each algorithm.
The first row of the file contains its number of rows and columns (Ox format).
